# PHP: Understanding Object Assignment and References

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in PHP related to object assignment and references.  Many developers unintentionally create copies of objects instead of references, leading to unexpected behavior when modifying object properties.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the correct approach using references.

This example highlights the importance of understanding the difference between assignment and reference when working with objects in PHP to avoid subtle bugs and ensure correct program behavior.
